        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>You might be wondering, why should I bother looking around in this website? To tell you the truth I am not sure. 
                For me this website acts as a way to express my thoughts in ways I have not before.
                I am normal dude who likes good food, is interested in technology, and I also have weird opinons on all subjects in life.</p>    
            <p>I am young, not that I want to mention my age, but I have been told I am a <b>"Boomer"</b>. </p>
